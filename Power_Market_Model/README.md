\## 🎯 Project Overview This platform provides a high-fidelity
simulation of \*\*European Power Market Dynamics\*\* through a
\*\*Bottom-Up Merit Order Dispatch\*\* model.

The tool utilizes verified \*\*2024 German Power Market fundamentals\*\*
to analyze how different generation technologies compete to satisfy
demand. It is designed as a technical showcase for energy economics,
carbon pricing sensitivity, and grid decarbonization analysis,
demonstrating the transition from traditional Excel modeling to
automated Python-based web applications.

\## 📈 Evolution: From Excel to Python This project originated as a
complex Excel-based analytical tool. This Streamlit extension was
developed to: \* \*\*Automate\*\* data processing and scenario
iterations. \* \*\*Enhance\*\* visualization capabilities with
interactive Plotly analytics. \* \*\*Improve Accessibility\*\* via a
cloud-based interface for stakeholders.

\*The original Excel prototype is available for download within the app
and in the \`/Excel\` directory.\*

\## 📊 Methodology: The Merit Order Dispatch The engine calculates the
\*\*Short-Run Marginal Cost (SRMC)\*\* for every power plant in the 2024
German fleet. The dispatch logic follows the European market clearing
mechanism:

1\. \*\*SRMC Calculation:\*\* \$\$SRMC\\ \[€/MWh\] = \\frac{Fuel\\
Price}{\\eta} + (Carbon\\ Price \\times Emission\\ Factor) + VOM\$\$ 2.
\*\*Economic Ranking:\*\* Assets are sorted from lowest to highest
marginal cost. 3. \*\*Market Clearing:\*\* The intersection of the
supply curve and the \*\*Residual Load\*\* determines the \*\*System
Marginal Price (SMP)\*\*.

\## 🔑 Key Features \* \*\*Granular Asset Database:\*\* 40+ modeled
plants across 7 technologies (Wind, Solar, Gas, Coal, Lignite, Hydro,
Biomass). \* \*\*2024 Scenarios:\*\* 10 pre-configured datasets
simulating winter peaks, high-renewable summer days, and supply shocks.
\* \*\*Environmental Impact:\*\* Real-time calculation of total CO₂
emissions and grid carbon intensity (g/kWh). \* \*\*Interactive
Visuals:\*\* Dynamic Merit Order \"Staircase\" charts and Technology
Stack breakdowns.

## 🏭 EU ETS Integration

This model includes advanced emissions trading system (ETS) analysis:

- **Coal-Gas Switching Price**: Calculates the carbon price threshold where gas 
  becomes more economical than coal
- **Market Regime Classification**: Automatically identifies whether scenarios 
  are coal-dominated or gas-dominated
- **BI-Ready Exports**: Long-format data exports optimized for Power BI/Tableau
